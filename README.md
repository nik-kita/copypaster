## Deno/Node & Backend/Frontend integration notes

1. the root folder is a vue.js project
2. but the installer is deno
3. all npm/node/vue related stuff is managed from package.json
4. though again - the Deno is used as installer
5. api - is member of deno workspace
6. the workspace is created as simple way to use Deno from root folder
7. the Makefile created for dev-purposes only
8. for example to format src with eslint and prettier but deno by it's native command
